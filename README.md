# lisafeet's professional portfolio

A portolio of the product work I've done over the years and ya know, ramblings about tech, as you do.

This porfolio was created using the Next.js [blog-starter template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).

Shout out to [Nicole Mors](https://github.com/nicolemors) who helped me get up and running with the next.js template and general design/development mentorship.

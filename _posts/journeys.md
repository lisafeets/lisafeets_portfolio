## Execution
As of Fall 2018, the number one reason Airship was losing new business deals was due to our lack of a Journey Builder type solution. Airship kicked off the "Cassiopeia" project to leapfrog the competition using Product Discovery techniques.

I led a product team to discover opportunities for an improved cross channel orchestration management platform. We interviewed 80+ customers, tested prototypes, reviewed competitor journey assets and uncovered the following two opportunities for innovation: 

* **Key Innovation 1: Separate and Automate key lifecycle transitions** Legacy journey builders force marketers to build all messaging into a single graph. We took a different approach allowing the marketer to focus on each lifecycle step individually and map goals together for automated lifecycle transitions.

* **Key Innovation 2: Simplify journey construction, optimization, and review** The traditional journey builder solutions force the marketer to create a new branch for each a/b test, control group, or QA test they want to run. We developed intuitive UX to contains the message logic within the message itself, decluttering the graph while providing the marketer with a simple interface to create with. 

With a solid basis in customer and market discovery, we built and launched [Airship Journeys](https://www.airship.com/app-experience-platform/customer-journey-optimization/journeys/) in November of 2019. 

I worked with leadership to build a now/next/later focused roadmap to ensure we continue delivering on customer value. Over the following year we released sales-leading and customer-loved solution expansions including an Experimentation platform and OOTB quickstart templates and guides.
